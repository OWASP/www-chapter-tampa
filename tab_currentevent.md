**Description:** 
Crowdsourced Security in Practice: Lessons from the Frontlines

As threats evolve faster than ever, traditional security models struggle to keep pace. Enter crowdsourced security—a model that taps into the global hacker community to uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries do. In this session, we’ll explore how Bugcrowd is helping organizations—from startups to the federal government—scale their security programs through managed bug bounty, vulnerability disclosure, and penetration testing. We’ll walk through real-world lessons learned, common pitfalls, and how aligning with frameworks like OWASP Top 10 enhances outcomes. Whether you’re an AppSec professional, pentester, or just curious about the power of ethical hacking at scale, this session will provide insights you can take back to your own environment.

**Agenda:**
* 11:15am - Registration and Lunch
