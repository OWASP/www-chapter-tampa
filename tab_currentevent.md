**Description:** In this bold new age of artificial intelligence, software is evolving at a blistering pace. From AI-generated code to automated devops to ingenious new AI applications, innovation is accelerating. Businesses across every industry stand to gain enormously in productivity and efficiency. However, with such great power comes great risk. As AI accelerates the pace of software innovation, it also increases the prevalence of vulnerabilities and exploits.

Given that application security teams are often under-resourced and equipped with weak technologies... What can they do to manage the inevitable complexity introduced by AI? This interactive talk will lay out the escalating challenges for application security and engineering teams while offering some practical solutions.

* 11:30am - Registration and Lunch
