**Description:** 
AI is here for business users. What does that mean for AppSec?

Gone are the days when coding skills were needed to create apps, automate processes, or reduce manual tasks. With AI now embedded in tools like email, business intelligence, and app development, business users can accomplish more without relying on IT or dev teams. However, this boost in productivity can come at the expense of security if not properly managed. As Gen AI, Copilots, and Agentic AI bring users closer to technology, security teams face tough choices: limit tool usage or risk data leakage. Traditionally seen as blockers, security teams now have the chance to transform into business enablers thanks to AI.

**Agenda:**
* 11:15am - Registration and Lunch
* 12:15pm - Speaker - Chris Fago - AI is here for business users. What does that mean for AppSec?
* 1:15pm - Depart

## Speakers
**Chris Fago** is a cybersecurity sales guy at Zenity with a knack for pretending to be more technical than he probably should.

At Zenity he's focused on helping solve the emerging security challenges tied to AI agents and low-code development—showing enterprises “How to fail at AppSec” or what didn’t work for others so they can close gaps often overlooked by traditional security tools in this new threat vector.

Previously, as a founding team member of Prisma Cloud (now part of Palo Alto Networks), he helped grow it into a market-leading CNAPP. During that time, Chris worked with major U.S. brands on complex digital transformations, helping them secure their cloud migrations and maybe even picking up a thing or two about Kubernetes.

Outside of work, Chris loves spending time with his family, hanging out at Atlanta’s botanical gardens and aquarium, obsessing over UFOs, and staying hopelessly devoted to Atlanta’s sports teams (despite the emotional toll they consistently deliver).
