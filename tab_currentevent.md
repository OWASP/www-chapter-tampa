**Description:** In 2023, 71% of enterprises admitted their AppSec programs were reactive, playing catch-up with vulnerability alerts -- while at the same time, applications remain the top target for threat actors. That adds up to increased business risk for a lot of companies and fuels an urgent need to improve application security strategies. But how?
The key is to move from a compliance-based approach to managing application risk.

Join Chris Lindsey, Application Security Evangelist, for an in-depth discussion of what it takes to stop playing defense when it comes to application security. He'll wrangle over topics like:

* The tell-tale signs of reactive mode
* The value of preventative best practices
* How to build security actions into the developer experience
* The need for a holistic view and effective prioritization
* Arming the security team with instant control at scale

**Agenda:**
* 11:30am - Registration and Lunch
* 12:00pm - Speaker - Chris Lindsey - From Reactive to Effective: Building Application Security that Works
* 1:00pm - Depart
